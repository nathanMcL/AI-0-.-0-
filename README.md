## Markov Chain Generator

- The Markov Chain is a mathematical model used to represent a sequence of events, where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained from the previous event, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This property is known as "memory lessness."<br>

## Generative Text Adventure Game

- This is a Generative AI Text Adventure Game based on a creative writing assignment I worked on during the summer of 2023 at the Evergreen State College. I then at one point, attempted to create a basic choose your adventure Python script named:<br>[Choose_Own_Adventure.py](https://github.com/nathanMcL/ComSci_projects/blob/main/Choose_Own_Adventure.py), from an online tutorial. <br>

This Text Adventure Game was further developed to its current form, through an AI-related course taken in the winter of 2024 at the Evergreen State College. <br>

- You can find the `Readme.md` file for the Text Adventure game in the corresponding directory or [Click Here](https://github.com/nathanMcL/AI-0-.-0-/tree/main/TextAdventure) to be taken there.<br>
